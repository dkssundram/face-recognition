Definition of Key Terms:

**Face Detection** : Finding the faces (any) in an image/frame. It does not care about “whose face “. It just counts number of persons in the given image/frame. To know the number of persons in a conference/store, it can be used.

**Face Recognition**: Recognizing the face in an image/frame. It identifies/recognizes the face that face belong to X person. When you upload a picture on Facebook, you get recommendation regarding tagging your friends or yourself. That is the face recognition capability of Facebook.

Face recognition is really a series of several related problems:

1. First, look at a picture and find all the faces in it
2. Second, focus on each face and be able to understand that even if a face is turned in a weird direction or in bad lighting, it is still the same person.
3. Third, be able to pick out unique features of the face that you can use to tell it apart from other people— like how big the eyes are, how long the face is, etc.
4. Finally, compare the unique features of that face to all the people you already know to determine the person’s name.
